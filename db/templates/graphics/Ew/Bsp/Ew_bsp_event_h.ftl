* FUNCTION:
*   EwBspWaitForSystemEvent
*
* DESCRIPTION:
*   The function EwBspWaitForSystemEvent should be called from the Embedded 
*   Wizard main loop in case there are no pending events, signals or timers that 
*   have to be processed by the UI application.
*   The function EwBspWaitForSystemEvent is used to sleep the given time span or
*   to suspend the UI task. The function returns as soon as a new system event
*   occurs or when the given timeout value is expired.
*   Typically, a system event is a touch event or a key event or any event
*   from your device driver.
*
* ARGUMENTS:
*   aTimeout - timeout value in milliseconds.
*
* RETURN VALUE:
*   None
