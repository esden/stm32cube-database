            <help_text>The integrated GIC collates and arbitrates from a large number of interrupt sources.&lt;br/&gt;
It provides:&lt;br/&gt;
• Masking of interrupts&lt;br/&gt;
• Prioritization of interrupts&lt;br/&gt;
• Distribution of the interrupts to the target processors&lt;br/&gt;
• Tracking the status of interrupts&lt;br/&gt;
• Generation of interrupts by software&lt;br/&gt;
• Support for security extensions&lt;br/&gt;
• Support for virtualization extensions&lt;br/&gt;
The GIC is a single functional unit located in the Cortex®-A7 MPCore processor.&lt;br/&gt;
The GIC consists of a shared distributor block and several CPU interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;
For each processor in the multiprocessor device, there is:&lt;br/&gt;
• one CPU interface&lt;br/&gt;
• a virtual interface control&lt;br/&gt;
• a virtual CPU interface.&lt;br/&gt;
