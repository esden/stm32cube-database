            <help_text>The nested vector interrupt controller NVIC includes the following features:&lt;br/&gt;
• 70 maskable interrupt channels (not including the 16 Cortex®-M33 FPU interrupt lines)&lt;br/&gt;
• 16 programmable priority levels (4 bits of interrupt priority used)&lt;br/&gt;
• low-latency exception and interrupt handling&lt;br/&gt;
• power management control&lt;br/&gt;
• implementation of System Control Registers&lt;br/&gt;
The NVIC and the processor core interface are closely coupled, enabling low-latency&lt;br/&gt;
interrupt processing and efficient processing of late arriving interrupts.&lt;br/&gt;
All interrupts including the core exceptions are managed by the NVIC.&lt;br/&gt;
