            <help_text>The master direct memory access (MDMA) is used in order to provide high-speed data&lt;br/&gt;
transfer between memory and memory or between peripherals and memory. Data can be&lt;br/&gt;
quickly moved by the MDMA without any CPU action. This keeps the CPU resources free&lt;br/&gt;
for other operations.&lt;br/&gt;
The MDMA controller provides a master AXI interface for main memory and peripheral&lt;br/&gt;
registers access (system access port) and a master AHB interface only for Cortex-M7 TCM&lt;br/&gt;
memory access (TCM access port).&lt;br/&gt;
The MDMA works in conjunction with the standard DMA controllers (DMA1 or DMA2). It&lt;br/&gt;
offers channels, each dedicated to manage memory access requests from one of&lt;br/&gt;
the DMA stream memory buffer or other peripherals (w/ integrated FIFO).&lt;br/&gt;
