            <help_text>The nested vector interrupt controller NVIC includes the following features:&lt;br/&gt;
• 52 maskable interrupt channels (not including the 16 interrupt lines of Cortex®-M4 with FPU)&lt;br/&gt;
• 16 programmable priority levels (4 bits of interrupt priority are used)&lt;br/&gt;
• low-latency exception and interrupt handling&lt;br/&gt;
• power management control&lt;br/&gt;
• implementation of system control registers&lt;br/&gt;
The NVIC and the processor core interface are closely coupled, which enables low latency&lt;br/&gt;
interrupt processing and efficient processing of late arriving interrupts.&lt;br/&gt;
All interrupts including the core exceptions are managed by the NVIC. For more information&lt;br/&gt;
on exceptions and NVIC programming, refer to programming manual PM0214.&lt;br/&gt;
