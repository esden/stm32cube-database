            <help_text>The OpenAMP framework provides conventions and standards to facilitate Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP) development for embedded systems.&lt;br/&gt;
                       The framework provides the following key capabilities:&lt;br/&gt;
                       1.Provides Life Cycle Management of remote processors (remoteproc) and Inter Processor Communication capabilities (RPMsg) between software contexts&lt;br/&gt;
                       2.Provides libraries usable with RTOS and Baremetal software environments&lt;br/&gt;
                       3.Compatibility with generic Linux remoteproc and rpmsg components&lt;br/&gt;
                       4.Running on a master processor and/or the remote coprocessor. For instance following configurations are supported:&lt;br/&gt;
                       - 4a. Linux master/Generic(Baremetal) remote&lt;br/&gt;
                       - 4b. RTOS master/RTOS remote&lt;br/&gt;
