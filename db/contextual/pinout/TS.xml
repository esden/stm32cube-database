                such as mobiles phones, induction cooktops and ovens, coffee machines, etc. This type of&lt;br/&gt;
                interface is more flexible and reliable compared to standard push buttons because mechanical&lt;br/&gt;
                parts are no longer needed.

            <help_text>All STM32L151xx devices except the value line provide a simple solution for adding capacitive sensing functionality to any application. &lt;br/&gt;
            Capacitive sensing technology is able to detect finger presence near an electrode which is protected from direct touch by a dielectric (glass, plastic, ...). &lt;br/&gt;
            The capacitive variation introduced by the finger (or any conductive object) is measured using a proven implementation based on a surface charge transfer&lt;br/&gt;
            acquisition principle. It consists of charging the electrode capacitance and then transferring a part of the accumulated charges into a sampling capacitor &lt;br/&gt;
            until the voltage across this capacitor has reached a specific threshold. In the STM32L1xxxx, this acquisition is managed directly by the GPIOs, timers and &lt;br/&gt;
            analog I/O groups.
