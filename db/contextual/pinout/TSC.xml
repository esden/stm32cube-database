            <help_text>The touch sensing controller provides a simple solution for adding capacitive sensing functionality &lt;br/&gt;
            to any application. Capacitive sensing technology is able to detect finger presence near an electrode which is &lt;br/&gt;
            protected from direct touch by a dielectric (for example glass, plastic). The capacitive variation introduced by &lt;br/&gt;
            the finger (or any conductive object) is measured using a proven implementation based on a surface charge transfer &lt;br/&gt;
            acquisition principle.&lt;br/&gt;
            The touch sensing controller is fully supported by the STMTouch touch sensing firmware library which is free to use &lt;br/&gt;
            and allows touch sensing functionality to be implemented reliably in the end application.

            <!-- Links that will be displayed on the help widgets:
            - filter: In case a selection needs to be made, use it as regexp on mcu name (STM32F042T6x)
            - display: string that will be displayed in front of the hyperlink
            - type: the type of file you want to display ("txt" "pdf", "chm", "html", "dynamic")
            dynamic stands for the document that have to be retrieved from the JSON database
            - reference: path to the document to be displayed (http or local path)
              If the file is dynamic, indicate the kind of file you want to display:
                * dataSheet => for datasheet document type
                * appNote => for application note document type
                * refMan => for reference manual document type

            - index: for pdf,html and chm type it specifies the chapter where the viewer will point
            for dynamic file it can specify a chapter except for application notes where it specifies
            the document display name (e.g. AN1015). This field may be left blank, then the full document
