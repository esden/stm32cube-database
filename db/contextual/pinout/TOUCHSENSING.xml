            <help_text>STMTouch touch sensing library provide a complete robust free source-code solution to be used on STM32 Series supporting eiher TS or TSC IP's. &lt;br/&gt;
            This solution allows designers familiar with the use of standard microcontrollers to create higher-end human interfaces by replacing conventional &lt;br/&gt;electromechanical switches by capacitive sensors.&lt;br/&gt;
            The xxxx-TOUCH-LIB is part of the application firmware. It allows combining various capacitive sensing touchkeys, linear or rotary touch sensors &lt;br/&gt;with traditional MCU features (communications, control of LEDs, beeper or LCD) in the same application.
