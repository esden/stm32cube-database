            <help_text>The Cortex-M33 with TrustZone and FPU is a highly energy-efficient processor designed for&lt;br/&gt;
            microcontrollers and deeply embedded applications, especially those requiring efficient&lt;br/&gt;
            security. &lt;br/&gt;
           The Cortex-M33 processor delivers a high computational performance with low-power&lt;br/&gt;
           consumption and an advanced response to interrupts. It features:&lt;br/&gt;

                • Arm® TrustZone technology, using the ARMv8-M main extension supporting secure&lt;br/&gt;
                and non-secure states&lt;br/&gt;
                • Memory protection units (MPUs), supporting up to 16 regions for secure and&lt;br/&gt;
                non-secure applications&lt;br/&gt;
                • Configurable secure attribute unit (SAU) supporting up to height memory regions as &lt;br/&gt;
                secure or non-secure &lt;br/&gt;
                • Floating-point arithmetic functionality with support for single precision arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;
             
            The processor supports a set of DSP instructions that allows an efficient signal processing&lt;br/&gt;
            and a complex algorithm execution.&lt;br/&gt;
           The Cortex-M33 processor supports the following bus interfaces:&lt;br/&gt;
                • System AHB bus: &lt;br/&gt;
                The system AHB (S-AHB) bus interface is used for any instruction fetch and data&lt;br/&gt;
                access to the memory-mapped SRAM, peripheral, external RAM and external device,&lt;br/&gt;
                or Vendor_SYS regions of the ARMv8-M memory map.&lt;br/&gt;
                • Code AHB bus:&lt;br/&gt;
                The code AHB (C-AHB) bus interface is used for any instruction fetch and data access&lt;br/&gt;
                to the code region of the ARMv8-M memory map.&lt;br/&gt;
