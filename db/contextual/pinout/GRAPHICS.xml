            <help_text>&lt;b&gt;STemWin:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STemWin Library is a professional graphical stack library enabling the building up of
                graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with any&lt;br/&gt;STM32, LCD/TFT display and LCD/TFT controller,
                taking advantage of STM32 hardware acceleration whenever possible.&lt;br/&gt;
                STemWin Library is a comprehensive solution coming with rich features such as JPG, GIF and PNG decoding,
                many widgets&lt;br/&gt;(checkboxes, buttons…) and a VNC server allowing to display remotely a local display,
                but also professional development&lt;br/&gt;tools such as GUIBuilder to create GUIS with simple drag and drop.&lt;br/&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;Key Features:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
                • Rich set of widgets (buttons, checkboxes, calendars, gauges, …).&lt;br/&gt;
                • Window and overlap manager.&lt;br/&gt;
                • Full set of Development tools: GUIBuilder to create screens, Font converter, simulator, ….&lt;br/&gt;
                • Free professional graphical stack library available in binary form.&lt;br/&gt;
                • Memory-sparing features (memory pool, per band screen creation, refresh only changed portions, …).&lt;br/&gt;
                • Able to handle many kinds of displays with optimized mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;
                • Alpha blending, Antialiasing, Cursors.&lt;br/&gt;
                • VNC server to display remotely the display via VNC protocol (based on TCP/IP).&lt;br/&gt;
                • Raw graphical renderer (Pixels, Shapes, Fonts, …).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;

               &lt;b&gt;TouchGFX:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TouchGFX is a GUI software framework owned by STMicroelectronics. Being a part of STM32 ECO System,TouchGFX is&lt;br/&gt;
               a cutting-edge free tool that takes full advantage of all graphical features of STM32 microcontrollers, making you capable &lt;br/&gt;
               of easy development of modern embedded GUIs.&lt;br/&gt;
               Supported graphical features like Transparency, alpha-blending, anti-aliased fonts and kerning, touch gestures, animations,&lt;br/&gt;
               screen transitions, Texture Mapping and Video playback.TouchGFX includes an easy-to-use GUI builder, TouchGFX Designer. &lt;br/&gt;
               &lt;b&gt;Key Features:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
                • Smartphone look and feel.&lt;br/&gt;
                • Minimum memory footprint and minimum CPU load. Still 30 to 60 frames per second.&lt;br/&gt;
                • Runs multiple display technologies and interfaces.   &lt;br/&gt;
                • Independent of RTOS. Runs on any OS/RTOS or on bare metal.          &lt;br/&gt;
                • Multiple language support. Alphabets and scripts, such as Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese are fully supported.  &lt;br/&gt;
                • EASY getting started. STM32 display kits fully supported. &lt;br/&gt;
                • Use your preferred IDE. IAR, ARM, GCC fully supported.&lt;br/&gt;
                • Free resources: Community holding  Knowledgebase, Videos, Examples and Forum.

            <!-- Links that will be displayed on the help widgets:
            - filter: In case a selection needs to be made, use it as regexp on mcu name (STM32F042T6x)
            - display: string that will be displayed in front of the hyperlink
            - type: the type of file you want to display ("txt" "pdf", "chm", "html", "dynamic")
            dynamic stands for the document that have to be retrieved from the JSON database
            - reference: path to the document to be displayed (http or local path)
              If the file is dynamic, indicate the kind of file you want to display:
                * dataSheet => for datasheet document type
                * appNote => for application note document type
                * refMan => for reference manual document type
                * usrMan => for user Manual document type
                * prgMan => for Programming Manual document type
                * errSheet => for Errata Sheet document type
            - index: for pdf,html and chm type it specifies the chapter where the viewer will point
            for dynamic file it can specify a chapter except for application notes where it specifies
            the document display name (e.g. AN1015). This field may be left blank, then the full document
            is displayed -->
