            <help_text>The Arm® Cortex®-M4 processor is a high-performance embedded processor which&lt;br/&gt;
            supports DSP instructions. It was developed to provide an optimized power consumption&lt;br/&gt;
            MCU, while delivering outstanding computational performance and low interrupt latency.&lt;br/&gt;
            The Arm® Cortex®-M4 processor is a highly efficient MCU featuring:&lt;br/&gt;
                • 3-stage pipeline with branch prediction&lt;br/&gt;
                • Harvard architecture&lt;br/&gt;
                • 32-bit System (S-BUS) interface&lt;br/&gt;
                • 32-bit I-BUS interface&lt;br/&gt;
                • 32-bit D-BUS interface&lt;br/&gt;
            The Arm® Cortex®-M4 processor also features a dedicated hardware adaptive real-time&lt;br/&gt;
            accelerator (ART Accelerator™). This is an instruction cache memory composed of sixty-&lt;br/&gt;
            four 256-bit lines, a 256-bit cache buffer connected to the 64-bit AXI interface and a 32-bit&lt;br/&gt;
            interface for non-cacheable accesses.&lt;br/&gt;
