            <help_text> The AES hardware accelerator can be used to both encipher and decipher data using AES&lt;br/&gt;
                algorithm. It is a fully compliant implementation of the following standard:&lt;br/&gt;
                • The advanced encryption standard (AES) as defined by Federal Information&lt;br/&gt;
                Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB 197, 2001 November 26)&lt;br/&gt;
                The accelerator encrypts and decrypts 128-bit blocks using either 128-bit or 256-bit keylength.&lt;br/&gt;
                It can also perform key derivation.&lt;br/&gt;
                The encryption or decryption key is stored in an internal register in order to minimize write operations&lt;br/&gt;
                By the CPU or DMA when processing several data blocks using the same key.
