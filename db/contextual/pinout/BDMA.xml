The BDMA controller features a single AHB master architecture.&lt;br/&gt;
There is one instance of BDMA with 8 channels.&lt;br/&gt;
Each channel is dedicated to managing memory access requests from one or more&lt;br/&gt;
peripherals. The BDMA includes an arbiter for handling the priority between DMA requests.&lt;br/&gt;
