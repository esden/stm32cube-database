			The peripheral supports ECB, and CBC chaining modes for key sizes of 128 or 256 bits, as well &lt;br/&gt;

			SAES has the possibility to load by hardware two STM32 hardware secret keys (boot hardware key &lt;br/&gt;
			BHK and derived hardware unique key DHUK), usable but not readable by application.&lt;br/&gt;
			SAES is an AMBA AHB slave peripheral accessible through 32-bit single accesses only.&lt;br/&gt;
			Other access types generate an AHB error, and other than 32-bit writes may corrupt the register content.&lt;br/&gt;
			The peripheral supports DMA single transfers for incoming and outgoing data (two DMA channels required).&lt;br/&gt;
			It is hardware-linked with the true random number generator (TRNG) and with the AES hardware accelerator.
