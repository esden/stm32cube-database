            <help_text>DCMI stands for Digital Camera Interface. The DCMI interface is used to connect a parallel&lt;br/&gt;
                camera module to the STM32. The camera generates a parallel data flow together with a pixel clock signal&lt;br/&gt;
                (DCMI_PIXCLK) which allows the interface to capture the incoming data flow.

            <help_text>DCMI stands for Digital Camera Interface. The DCMI interface is used to connect a parallel&lt;br/&gt;
                camera module to the STM32. The camera generates a parallel data flow together with a pixel clock signal&lt;br/&gt;
                (DCMI_PIXCLK) which allows the interface to capture the incoming data flow.
