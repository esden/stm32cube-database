            and low-power analog peripherals such as op amps, comparators, LCD, 12-bit DACs and 16-bit ADCs (hardware oversampling).<br/><br/>
            The new STM32L4+ series also embeds advanced graphic features enabling state‐of‐the‐art graphic user interfaces.<br/>
            The Chrom‐ART Accelerator™, ST's proprietary 2D hardware graphic accelerator, efficiently handles repetitive graphic operations<br/>
            releasing the main CPU capabilities for real time processing or even more advanced graphic operations.<br/>
            The Chrom‐ART Accelerator is coupled with the large embedded SRAM, the Chrom‐GRC™ round display memory optimizer,<br/>
            the high-throughput Octo-SPI interface and to the advanced TFT and DSI controllers, allowing you to achieve ‘smartphone‐like’<br/>

            The STM32WB platform is an evolution of the well‐known market-leading STM32L4 ultra-low-power series of MCUs.<br/>
            It provides the same digital and analog peripherals suitable for applications requiring extended battery life<br/>
            and complex functionalities.<br/><br/>
            STM32WB proposes a variety of communication assets, a practical crystal-less USB2.0 FS interface, audio support,<br/>
            an LCD driver, up to 72 GPIOs, an integrated SMPS for power consumption optimization, and multiple low-power modes<br/>
            to maximize battery life.<br/><br/>
            On top of wireless and ultra‐low‐power aspects, a particular focus was placed on embedding security hardware functions<br/>
            such as a 256‐bit AES, PCROP, JTAG Fuse, PKA (elliptic curve encryption engine), and Root Secure Services (RSS).<br/>
            The RSS allows authenticating OTA communications, regardless of the radio stack or application.<br/><br/>
            The STM32WB55 Bluetooth 5 -certified device offers Mesh 1.0 software support, multiple profiles and flexibility to<br/>
            integrate proprietary BLE stacks.<br/><br/>
            OpenThread-certified software stack is available. The radio can also run BLE/OpenThread protocols concurrently. The<br/>
            embedded generic MAC allows the usage of other IEEE 802.15.4 proprietary stacks like ZigBee®, or proprietary protocols,<br/>
            giving even more options for connecting devices to the Internet of Things (IoT).]]>
