            LCD interface, comparator, DAC and hardware encryption.<br/><br/>
            More than just ultra-low-power MCUs, the STM32 L1 series offers a wide portfolio of features, memory sizes and package pin counts.<br/>
            Combining ultra-low power and performance, the portfolio covers from 32 to 512 Kbytes of Flash memory (with up to 80 Kbytes of SDRAM<br/>
            and 16 Kbytes of true embedded EEPROM) and from 48 to 144 pins.<br/><br/>
            This innovative architecture (voltage scaling, ultra-low-power MSI oscillator) gives your design more performance for a very low power<br/>
            budget. The large number of embedded peripherals, such as USB, LCD interface, op amp, comparators, ADC with fast on/off mode, DAC,
            capacitive touch and AES, makes the STM32 L1 series an expandable platform to fit all your requirements.<br/><br/>
