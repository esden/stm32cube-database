            The STM32WB platform is an evolution of the well‐known market-leading STM32L4 ultra-low-power series of MCUs.<br/>
            It provides the same digital and analog peripherals suitable for applications requiring extended battery life<br/>
            and complex functionalities.<br/><br/>
            STM32WB proposes a variety of communication assets, a practical crystal-less USB2.0 FS interface, audio support,<br/>
            an LCD driver, up to 72 GPIOs, an integrated SMPS for power consumption optimization, and multiple low-power modes<br/>
            to maximize battery life.<br/><br/>
            On top of wireless and ultra‐low‐power aspects, a particular focus was placed on embedding security hardware functions<br/>
            such as a 256‐bit AES, PCROP, JTAG Fuse, PKA (elliptic curve encryption engine), and Root Secure Services (RSS).<br/>
            The RSS allows authenticating OTA communications, regardless of the radio stack or application.<br/><br/>
            The STM32WB55 Bluetooth 5 -certified device offers Mesh 1.0 software support, multiple profiles and flexibility to<br/>
            integrate proprietary BLE stacks.<br/><br/>
            OpenThread-certified software stack is available. The radio can also run BLE/OpenThread protocols concurrently. The<br/>
            embedded generic MAC allows the usage of other IEEE 802.15.4 proprietary stacks like ZigBee®, or proprietary protocols,<br/>
            giving even more options for connecting devices to the Internet of Things (IoT).]]>
