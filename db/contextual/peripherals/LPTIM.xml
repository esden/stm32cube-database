            <help_text>LPTIM (Low Power TIMer) specifically helps to reduce the power consumption while the&lt;br/&gt;
                system is in low-power mode. The STM32 low-power timer  allows the system to perform simple tasks&lt;br/&gt;
                while the power consumption is kept at an absolute minimum.
