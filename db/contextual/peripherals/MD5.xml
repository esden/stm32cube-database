                message is broken up into chunks of 512-bit blocks (sixteen 32-bit words); the message is padded so&lt;br/&gt;

            <help_text>MD5 digests is used in the software world to provide some assurance that a transferred file has arrived intact.&lt;br/&gt;
                MD5 processes a variable-length message into a fixed-length output of 128 bits. The input&lt;br/&gt;
                message is broken up into chunks of 512-bit blocks (sixteen 32-bit words); the message is padded so&lt;br/&gt;
                that its length is divisible by 512.

            <!-- Links that will be displayed on the help widgets:
            - filter: In case a selection needs to be made, use it as regexp on mcu name (STM32F042T6x)
            - display: string that will be displayed in front of the hyperlink
            - type: the type of file you want to display ("txt" "pdf", "chm", "html", "dynamic")
            dynamic stands for the document that have to be retrieved from the JSON database
            - reference: path to the document to be displayed (http or local path)
              If the file is dynamic, indicate the kind of file you want to display:
                * dataSheet => for datasheet document type
                * appNote => for application note document type
                * refMan => for reference manual document type
                * usrMan => for user Manual document type
                * prgMan => for Programming Manual document type
                * errSheet => for Errata Sheet document type
            - index: for pdf,html and chm type it specifies the chapter where the viewer will point
            for dynamic file it can specify a chapter except for application notes where it specifies
            the document display name (e.g. AN1015). This field may be left blank, then the full document
            is displayed -->
