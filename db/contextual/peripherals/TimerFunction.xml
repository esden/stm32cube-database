                * appNote => for application note document type
                * refMan => for reference manual document type
                * usrMan => for user Manual document type
                * prgMan => for Programming Manual document type
                * errSheet => for Errata Sheet document type
            - index: for pdf,html and chm type it specifies the chapter where the viewer will point
            for dynamic file it can specify a chapter except for application notes where it specifies
            the document display name (e.g. AN1015). This field may be left blank, then the full document
            is displayed -->
