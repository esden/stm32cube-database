            <help_text>Triple DES, officially the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA or Triple DEA), is a&lt;br/&gt;
                symmetric-key block cipher, which applies the Data Encryption Standard (DES) cipher algorithm three times &lt;br/&gt;
                to each data block.&lt;br/&gt;
                The original DES cipher's key size of 56 bits was generally sufficient when that algorithm was designed, but&lt;br/&gt;
                the availability of increasing computational power made brute-force attacks feasible.&lt;br/&gt;
                Triple DES provides a relatively simple method of increasing the key size of DES to protect against such&lt;br/&gt;
                attacks, without the need to design a completely new block cipher algorithm.
