              If the file is dynamic, indicate the kind of file you want to display:
                * dataSheet => for datasheet document type
                * appNote => for application note document type
                * refMan => for reference manual document type
                * usrMan => for user Manual document type
                * prgMan => for Programming Manual document type
                * errSheet => for Errata Sheet document type
            - index: for pdf,html and chm type it specifies the chapter where the viewer will point
