            <help_text>Differents technologies are giving designers even more options for connecting devices to the Internet of Things (IoT).&lt;br/&gt;
			IoT applications requiring full coverage and mobility will focus on cellular technologies such as LTE-M and NB-IoT technologies&lt;br/&gt; 
		    based on 4G and 5G in the future. The others will rely on low-power technologies operating in unlicensed bands, such as Sigfox&lt;br/&gt;
			or LoRaWAN. The majority of them will use short or medium range wireless technologies such as BluetoothÂ®, WLAN/Wi-Fi, Zigbee,&lt;br/&gt; 
			Thread and others.&lt;br/&gt;
			Different certified configurations are available to provide more freedom in terms of device sizing and OTA capability,&lt;br/&gt;
			to enable platform optimization.

            <!-- Links that will be displayed on the help widgets:
            - filter: In case a selection needs to be made, use it as regexp on mcu name (STM32F042T6x)
            - display: string that will be displayed in front of the hyperlink
            - type: the type of file you want to display ("txt" "pdf", "chm", "html", "dynamic")
            dynamic stands for the document that have to be retrieved from the JSON database
            - reference: path to the document to be displayed (http or local path)
              If the file is dynamic, indicate the kind of file you want to display:
                * dataSheet => for datasheet document type
                * appNote => for application note document type
                * refMan => for reference manual document type
                * usrMan => for user Manual document type
                * prgMan => for Programming Manual document type
                * errSheet => for Errata Sheet document type
            - index: for pdf,html and chm type it specifies the chapter where the viewer will point
            for dynamic file it can specify a chapter except for application notes where it specifies
            the document display name (e.g. AN1015). This field may be left blank, then the full document
            is displayed -->
